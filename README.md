# PersonalProjects
Here I will be uploading some "big" personal projects, which will be updated with time, as I learn new stuff


# Portfolio-Project
This is my portfolio project. At the moment is fully made by HTML5 and css (well and a really tiny JS script). 
I'll make my personal web using this, as I improve it and learn more about designs, animatins, etc. 
By now, It is fully responsive, and kind of interactive. 
I'll be updating this as I learn more about JS and CSS.
